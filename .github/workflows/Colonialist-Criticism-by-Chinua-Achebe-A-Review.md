# Colonialist Criticism by Chinua Achebe: A Review
 
In this essay, originally published in 1974 and later included in his collection *Hopes and Impediments* (1988), Chinua Achebe, one of the most prominent African writers of the twentieth century, challenges the colonialist assumptions and attitudes that have shaped the criticism of African literature. He argues that colonialist criticism is based on a false dichotomy between European and African cultures, and that it fails to appreciate the complexity, diversity and richness of African literary traditions. He also criticizes the colonialist tendency to patronize, misrepresent and dismiss African writers as either imitators of European models or exotic primitives. He calls for a more respectful and nuanced approach to African literature that recognizes its historical, social and aesthetic contexts, as well as its contribution to world literature.

Achebe illustrates his points by drawing on his own experience as a writer and a reader of African literature. He cites examples of colonialist criticism from various sources, such as Honor Tracy, who questioned his authenticity and modernity as an African writer; Charles Larson, who accused him of being too Westernized and not African enough; and Margaret Lawrence, who praised him for transcending his Africanness and becoming a universal writer. He also refers to other African writers and critics who have faced similar challenges, such as Amos Tutuola, Christopher Okigbo, Davidson Nicol and Adrian Roscoe. He shows how these critics have either ignored or distorted the cultural and literary influences that have shaped African writers, such as oral traditions, indigenous languages, colonial education, postcolonial politics and global connections.
 
Achebe's essay is not only a critique of colonialist criticism, but also a defense of his own artistic vision and choices. He explains why he writes in English, the language of his colonizers, but also incorporates elements of Igbo language and culture into his novels. He rejects the notion that he is a mere spokesman for his people or a propagandist for African nationalism. He asserts his right to be a creative artist who explores the human condition in all its aspects, without being confined by labels or expectations. He affirms his belief in the value and validity of African literature as part of the world's literary heritage.

Achebe's essay is also a call for dialogue and collaboration among writers and critics from different backgrounds and perspectives. He acknowledges the difficulties and dangers of cross-cultural communication, especially in the context of colonialism and its aftermath. He warns against the pitfalls of stereotyping, essentializing and homogenizing African literature and culture. He also cautions against the temptation of romanticizing or idealizing Africa as a pure and innocent alternative to the corrupt and decadent West. He advocates for a more balanced and realistic view of Africa that recognizes its strengths and weaknesses, its achievements and challenges, its diversity and unity.
 
At the same time, Achebe does not reject or deny the influence and importance of European literature and culture. He admits that he has learned a lot from reading and studying European writers, such as Shakespeare, Dickens, Joyce and Conrad. He also appreciates the contributions of some European critics who have shown genuine interest and respect for African literature, such as Frank Willet, Ivan Van Sertima and Lee Morrissey. He argues that African literature can benefit from a constructive dialogue with European literature, as long as it is based on mutual understanding and appreciation, not on domination and exploitation. He suggests that African literature can offer new insights and perspectives to European literature, as well as challenge some of its assumptions and prejudices.
 
In conclusion, Achebe's essay is a powerful and persuasive statement of his literary philosophy and practice. It is also a valuable contribution to the debate on the canon of world literature and the role of criticism in shaping it. It is a testament to his vision and courage as an African writer who has faced many obstacles and criticisms, but has also achieved many successes and recognitions. It is a reflection of his hope and optimism for the future of African literature and its place in the world.
